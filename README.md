# Wave Energy Forecasting and Storage-Aware Smoothing

This repository contains a small set of Jupyter notebooks exploring short-term wave-energy forecasting and storage-aware smoothing.

The focus is on working with open wave-resource data, estimating simplified wave energy converter power output, evaluating forecasting and uncertainty methods, and connecting the results to BESS/HESS grid-integration metrics.

## Conda environment

The environment is defined in `environment.yml`.

The environment was created using:

```text
conda 26.3.2
```

Create and activate the environment with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wave-energy-storage-ml
```

The environment installs MHKiT from its GitHub source repository, so `git` is included as an environment dependency.

A `requirements.txt` file is also provided as a package-version snapshot of the working environment. It is mainly included for transparency and reproducibility; `environment.yml` remains the recommended installation file.

## Data

Data files are not committed to the repository. The wave observations used in the examples are downloaded and prepared in [`01_wave_data_preparation.ipynb`](notebooks/01_wave_data_preparation.ipynb), which documents the Copernicus Marine / EMODnet source, selected buoy, QC handling, and processed output generation.

## Notebooks overview

* 00 – Literature Map: Wave-Energy Forecasting, Uncertainty, and Storage-Aware Smoothing ([PDF](outputs/pdf/00_literature_map.pdf) | [Notebook](notebooks/00_literature_map.ipynb))

  Maps the literature motivation behind the repository, connecting BESS/grid-integration context with wave-energy forecasting, uncertainty estimation, WEC smoothing, and BESS/HESS relevance.

* 01 – Wave Data Preparation: Copernicus/EMODnet In-Situ Sea-State Data for WEC Power Estimation ([PDF](outputs/pdf/01_wave_data_preparation.pdf) | [Notebook](notebooks/01_wave_data_preparation.ipynb))

  Retrieves and prepares Copernicus Marine / EMODnet in-situ wave observations from the Leixões coastal buoy, including QC inspection, 30-minute time-grid alignment, and processed sea-state variables for later WEC power estimation and forecasting.

* 02 – WEC Power Estimation: Leixões Sea-State Characterization and Generic Power Matrix ([PDF](outputs/pdf/02_wec_power_estimation.pdf) | [Notebook](notebooks/02_wec_power_estimation.ipynb))

  Explores Leixões sea-state height, period, direction, and spreading variables, then builds a simplified generic power-matrix-style WEC estimate. The resulting estimated WEC power signal is intended for later forecasting, uncertainty, and storage-smoothing notebooks, not as a validated device model.
